title: Privacy &amp; terms
---

<p>
  The privacy and terms described apply if you're using a hosted PopIt
  instance &mdash; that is, one <em>we host for you</em>. If you're technical,
  and you have access to your own server, remember that you can host PopIt yourself
  instead.
</p>

<h2>Privacy</h2>
<h3>Your personal details:</h3>
<p>
  When you create a PopIt instance, you give us your name and your email
  address (we send you a confirmation link). You can trust us not to abuse
  this: we'll never sell or distribute any personal information you share
  with us except when compelled by law. We'll never spam you with non-PopIt
  emails. However, <strong>we do sometimes send emails out to instance
  owners</strong> like yourself if something important comes up (for example,
  if there's a security issue or a major version update you need to know about).
</p>
<h3>The data you provide:</h3>
<p>
  Any information you enter into your PopIt instance will be made public and
  searchable. Don't put any data into a PopIt instance here that is private
  or unsuitable for public use.
</p>

<h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>

<p>
  By uploading or entering data into PopIt (except your private login
  details) you consent for that data to be released under the
  <a href="http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/">
    Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL)
  </a>. You will always be able to download all your data for re-use elsewhere,
  including on local instances of PopIt.
</p>

<p>
  We reserve the right to remove data or block accounts if the continued
  functioning of the wider PopIt site is threatened, or if your use of the
  site is clearly anti-social.
</p>

<p>
  We will not share your private login details with anyone else, but the
  data you author on the site will be public and world readable by default.
</p>

<p>
  PopIt is a platform. mySociety does not pre-moderate content, and the
  content does not belong to mySociety. Any concerns about bad data should
  be initially directed at the person who owns and maintains the individual
  PopIt site. If this is unsuccessful, then you can contact us at
  hello@mysociety.org
</p>

<p>
  As a UK registered charity mySociety cannot subsidise commercial companies
  by providing them with free services. If you want to make use of PopIt for
  commercial purposes, please mail commercial@mysociety.org to discuss the
  options.
</p>

<p>
  mySociety is keen for the data on PopIt instances to be up to date. To
  that extent we reserve the right to post warnings that data is potentially
  out of data on pages and in the API when we believe that it might be
  misleading.
